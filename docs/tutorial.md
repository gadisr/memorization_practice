Here’s a beginner-friendly tutorial on how to solve a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube blindfolded — drawn from trusted sources (J Perm’s website, RUWIX, Teach Kids Engineering, Cubelelo) — and broken into clear steps with visuals and tips. You’ll want to be comfortable solving the cube *sighted* first (i.e., just regular solving) before attempting blindfolded.

## 1. What you are doing (and how this is possible)

* Solving the cube blindfolded (commonly called “3BLD” in cubing) means: you *inspect* the scramble, memorize certain information, put on a blindfold, then execute moves purely from memory to restore the cube. ([Cubelelo®][1])
* The core idea: you break the solve into two phases: **memorization** and **execution**. Memorize where pieces need to go; then execute via fixed algorithms without looking. ([Cubelelo®][2])
* You don’t need to memorize dozens of complex algorithms. Using the beginner method (commonly the Old Pochmann method) you can solve with only a few main algorithms for switching pieces, plus memorization of letters. ([Ruwix][3])
* Why it works: You use a *buffer* position (one fixed piece you pay attention to), swap that with other pieces one by one using a swap algorithm + setup/undo. That way you only disturb pieces you intend to. ([J Perm][4])

---

## 2. Prerequisites – What you must know already

Before attempting this, you should:

* Know how to solve the Rubik’s Cube in the regular (sighted) way — so you understand piece locations, notation (R U L etc.), buffer pieces, piece orientation.
* Be comfortable with the cube’s notation: R, U, F, L, D, B and their primes (’) and 2s.
* Choose and stick to a fixed cube orientation/orientation for your solves (for example: white on top, green front) so your letter scheme and memorization remain consistent. ([Teach Kids Engineering][5])

---

## 3. Choose your method, orientation & lettering scheme

### Orientation

Pick a consistent way to hold your cube every time you do a blindfold solve. For example: white center up, green center front. ([J Perm][4])

### Method

For beginners, use the Old Pochmann method:

* Solve edges using one swap-algorithm repeatedly.
* Then solve corners using one swap-algorithm repeatedly.
  ([Ruwix][3])
  Later you can explore more advanced methods like M2 or 3-Style. ([Cubelelo®][6])

### Lettering / labeling scheme

You’ll assign each piece (edge sticker, corner sticker) a letter from A, B, C… or something similar (common scheme: the “Speffz” scheme). You’ll memorize sequences of letters that tell you how pieces cycle. ([Teach Kids Engineering][5])

## 4. Memorization Phase

Below is how to approach memorization in the beginner method.

### Step 4.1 – Memorize piece locations

* Look at the scrambled cube (you still can see it). For each *type* of piece (edges first for many methods, or corners first; the beginner method often does edges then corners) determine which piece is in each buffer target and where it should go.
* Example: You see the buffer piece (let’s say UR edge) has a sticker that belongs in position “X”. So you note “buffer → X”. Then at X position there is a sticker that belongs to “Y”, so you note “X → Y”. Continue until you close the cycle back at the buffer. Then pick another unsolved piece, start a new cycle.

### Step 4.2 – Build letter sequence

* Convert the piece-positions into letters (using your scheme). For example: buffer position is letter A, target is letter G, etc. So you get sequences like “AGKM…”
* You can memorize these letter sequences by converting into words, imagery, stories — whatever helps you recall. ([Cubelelo®][7])
* You’ll have one sequence for edges and one for corners.

### Step 4.3 – Review and check

* Before putting on the blindfold, review your memorized sequence and check you are confident.
* Make sure you know which pieces you will solve first when executing.

## 5. Execution Phase (with blindfold on)

With the memorization done, you now execute the solve blindfolded.

### Step 5.1 – Solve edges

* Using your fixed buffer (say UR edge), you look at your memorized first letter: the target position for the buffer sticker.
* Perform *setup moves* (only allowed moves that don’t disturb already solved pieces) to bring the target location’s piece into the position that will swap with the buffer.
* Then perform the *swap algorithm* (for example: R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F') which swaps buffer with target. ([Ruwix][3])
* Undo the setup moves. Now one piece is solved. The new piece that landed in the buffer will be next in your sequence. Continue until all edges are solved (or you finish your memorized sequence).

### Step 5.2 – Handle parity (if needed)

* Sometimes you’ll reach a point where a single piece is left out of the cycle — called parity in blind solves. The tutorial will often mention a parity algorithm to fix that. ([YouTube][8])

### Step 5.3 – Solve corners

* After edges, you shift to corners. Use a fixed corner buffer (for example the top-left-back corner) and repeat the same idea: follow your memorized corner letter sequence, do setup moves, apply the corner swap algorithm, undo setups. ([Cubelelo®][1])

### Step 5.4 – Remove blindfold & check

* Once you finish executing your sequences, remove the blindfold and — ideally — the cube is solved. If something is wrong, you’ll need to review your memorization or setup/execution.

## 6. Practice tips & memorization tricks

* Use **consistent orientation** every solve (same face up/front). This reduces confusion. ([Teach Kids Engineering][5])
* When memorizing, convert letter sequences into **stories or vivid images**. For example, “A→G→T→H” might become “Aho Goes To Hotel”. This helps memory recall. ([Cubelelo®][7])
* As you execute blindfolded, use your **fingers** or tactile feel to keep track of the buffer location, but don’t look.
* Start with *very small* letter sequences (e.g., 8-10 letters) to get comfortable, then increase as you gain confidence.
* After each solve, review what went wrong if you failed: was memorization the problem? Setup moves? The algorithm?
* Remember: the more you practice, the fewer pieces you’ll have out of place, the faster you will become. Even the beginner method can be done in under 2 minutes with practice. ([J Perm][9])

## 7. Summary of steps

1. Know how to solve the cube normally and the notation.
2. Choose orientation (e.g., white up, green front) and commit to it.
3. Choose a method (Old Pochmann for beginners) and learn the buffer positions + swap algorithms.
4. Memorization: label all piece positions with letters; build your letter sequences for edges and corners.
5. Put on the blindfold.
6. Execution: Solve edges with buffer swaps → Handle parity if needed → Solve corners with buffer swaps.
7. Remove blindfold, check solved.
8. Review and practice.
