Tips for success: 
- Add drills
- slowly but surely
- Learn algorithms automatically
- Use intuition when possibel at first
- Work on your memory
- Use this guide alongside drills and interactive guides in the site

We assume you are familiar with the cube: 
- centers, corners, edges, faces
- lettering system

This solution is divided to 3 stages
tracing
memorizing
execution


Phase 1: tracing
New term: buffer piece - what is a buffer etc.
- This phase is about finding the correct location of each piece
- In this phase we use the lettering system to construct string of letters we will use later to solve the cube
- We start at the buffer piece, trace its location in a solved cube (using the lettering system), then, 
  find the correct location of that piece and so on until getting back to buffer piece.
- If all pieces are covered, good, otherwise, start with a unvovered piece, and do as the first cycle until back to that peice.
- This is done for edges and corners.
- At the end of this phase, you should have 2 sequences of strings, representing pieces in the lettering system, for both edges and corners.

Phase 2: Memorizing
- During phase 1 while construcint the sequences, you should use memorization techniques to make sure you remember the sequences.

Phase 3: Execution
Algorithms: edges swap, corner swap, parity
setup moves and un-setup modes per letter in the lettering system
- start with edges, do the setup move for the first letter, perform edges swap algorithm, and then the inverse setup move. 
- This will place the piece in its position, put that piece back in its place, and place the next piece to solve in the buffer piece
- Keep doing that for all the edges sequences.
- If the number of letters was odd, perform parity algorithm
- Now, for corners, do the same. do the setup move, corners swap, and inverse setup.
- Thats it, cube is solved.
