### Scalability Requirements

## Design Constraints

### Must Work In

- Single color (for stamps, embroidery, etc.)
- Light backgrounds (white, light gray)
- Dark backgrounds (if needed in future)

### Must Avoid
- Overly complex designs that don't scale down well
- Cartoonish or playful blindfold imagery
- Generic cube designs (must be distinctive)
- Cluttered compositions
- Designs that rely solely on color (must work in B&W)
- Text-heavy designs (logo should be primarily visual)

## Brand Message

The logo should communicate:
1. **Blindfold Cubing**: The core activity (solving Rubik's cube blindfolded)
2. **Training Focus**: This is a serious training tool, not just entertainment
3. **Memory & Visualization**: The mental skills being developed
4. **Professional Quality**: Trustworthy, well-designed tool

4. **Usage Guidelines**: Brief guide on how to use the logo
5. **Color Specifications**: Exact color codes and usage rules

## Timeline & Priority

- **Priority**: High (needed for SEO meta tags, social sharing, brand identity)
- **Current Status**: Logo referenced in structured data but doesn't exist yet
- **Urgency**: Needed for:
  - Open Graph images (social media)
  - Favicon (browser tabs)
  - Structured data (Google Search Console)
  - Brand consistency

## Success Criteria

The logo is successful if it:
- ✅ Immediately communicates "blindfold cubing training"
- ✅ Looks professional and trustworthy
- ✅ Works at all required sizes (16px to 512px+)
- ✅ Is recognizable in color and monochrome
- ✅ Differentiates from generic cube logos
- ✅ Appeals to serious cubers (not too playful)
- ✅ Represents memory/visualization training aspect
- ✅ Works with the existing color scheme (#667eea, #2196F3)
- ✅ Fits the minimalist, clean design aesthetic of the site

## Additional Notes

- The application focuses on **memory training** and **visualization skills** - this is as important as the cube itself
- Consider abstract representations of memory, visualization, or mental pathways
- The blindfold element should be subtle and elegant, not the main focus
- Logo should feel like it belongs to a **training platform**, not just a cubing website
- Consider how the logo will look next to the domain name "blindfoldcubing.com"
