# Technical Plan: Add Corner Validation to Match Edge Validation Functionality

## Brief Context

The user has added corner swap and corner setup moves to the system and now wants to implement corner validation functionality that matches the existing edge validation system. Currently, only edge validation is fully functional in the `SequenceValidator` class, while corner validation exists in `CornerTracingValidator` but lacks the same comprehensive functionality as edge validation. The goal is to implement the same validation features for corners that already exist for edges.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure:
- ✅ `SequenceValidator` class with comprehensive edge validation (fully functional)
- ✅ `CornerTracingValidator` class with basic corner validation (needs enhancement)
- ✅ `MoveApplier` class with setup moves for both edges and corners
- ✅ Edge swap algorithm: `R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'`
- ✅ Corner swap algorithm: `R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R` (newly added)
- ✅ Setup moves for all edge positions (a-x) and corner positions (B-X) (newly added)

### Files to be Created:
- `src/services/corner-sequence-validator.ts` - Corner validation service matching edge validation functionality

### Files to be Modified:
- `src/services/corner-tracing-validator.ts` - Enhance to match edge validation features
- `src/services/move-applier.ts` - Add corner setup moves integration
- `src/models/sequence-validation.ts` - Add corner validation result interfaces

## Algorithm Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Corner Setup Moves Integration

1. **Add Corner Setup Moves to MoveApplier**:
   - Add corner setup moves mapping (B-X positions)
   - Implement corner setup move lookup functionality
   - Add corner setup move inverse calculation
   - Ensure corner setup moves work with existing move application system

2. **Update CornerTracingValidator**:
   - Add corner sequence conversion (letters to moves)
   - Implement corner setup move + corner swap + inverse setup move pattern
   - Add corner validation result interfaces
   - Match the validation pattern used in edge validation

### Phase 2: Corner Validation Implementation

3. **Create Corner Sequence Validator**:
   - Implement `validateCornerSequence()` method matching edge validation
   - Add corner position validation (check if corners are in correct positions)
   - Add corner orientation validation (check for twisted corners)
   - Add corner sequence scoring system

4. **Corner Validation Features**:
   - Corner position accuracy checking
   - Corner orientation validation (twisted corners)
   - Corner cycle completion analysis
   - Corner setup move accuracy validation
   - Detailed corner analysis and feedback

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing

5. **Update MoveApplier for Corners**:
   - Add corner setup moves to the setup moves map
   - Implement corner move conversion functionality
   - Add corner move application using cube-scrambler
   - Ensure corner validation works with existing cube manipulation

6. **Add Corner Validation Results**:
   - Corner validation result interfaces
   - Corner position analysis (which corners are correct/incorrect)
   - Corner orientation analysis (which corners are twisted)
   - Corner scoring and feedback system

## Key Features to Implement

### Corner Validation (Matching Edge Validation):
- **Corner Position Check**: Validate that corners are in correct positions
- **Corner Orientation Check**: Validate that corners are not twisted
- **Corner Position Accuracy**: Score based on correct corner positions
- **Corner Cycle Validation**: Ensure all corners are properly traced
- **Corner Setup Move Validation**: Verify correct setup moves are applied

### Corner Validation System:
- **Corner Sequence Validation**: Validate corner letter sequences like edge validation
- **Corner Results**: Detailed corner analysis and feedback
- **Corner Scoring**: Score based on corner position and orientation accuracy
- **Corner Analysis**: Comprehensive feedback for corner mistakes

### Integration Points:
- **MoveApplier**: Use corner setup moves (B-X) with corner swap algorithm
- **CornerTracer**: Leverage existing corner tracing functionality
- **Cube Scrambler**: Use existing scramble generation and cube manipulation
- **Corner Swap Algorithm**: `R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R`

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Corner Validation**: Full corner validation functionality matching edge validation
2. **Corner Setup Moves**: Integration of corner setup moves (B-X) with corner swap algorithm
3. **Corner Feedback**: Detailed analysis of corner position and orientation performance
4. **Corner Scoring**: Scoring system that accounts for corner accuracy
5. **Parity with Edges**: Corner validation has the same features and functionality as edge validation

This plan implements corner validation functionality that matches the existing edge validation system, providing users with the same comprehensive validation features for corners that they already have for edges.
