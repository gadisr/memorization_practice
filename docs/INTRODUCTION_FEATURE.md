# BLD Memorization Introduction Feature

## Overview

This document describes the new introduction and educational content feature added to the BLD Memory Trainer application.

## What Was Added

### 1. General BLD Technique Introduction

A comprehensive introduction to the BLD (Blindfold) cubing memorization technique that explains:
- What BLD cubing memorization involves (letter-pair system, Speffz notation)
- The challenge: memorizing ~20 letter pairs in under a minute
- The three key skills: Speed, Story Building, and Recall Accuracy
- How the trainer helps develop these skills progressively

**Access:** Click the info button (‚ÑπÔ∏è) next to "Start Training Session" on the setup screen.

### 2. Individual Drill Introductions

Each drill now has detailed explanations including:

#### Flash Pairs
- **What it is:** Individual letter pairs displayed one at a time for instant image association
- **How it helps:** Builds instant letter-to-image conversion speed (under 1 second per pair)

#### 2-Pair Fusion
- **What it is:** Combines two letter pairs into a single coherent mini-scene
- **How it helps:** Teaches image fusion skills to reduce cognitive load and improve recall

#### 3-Pair Chain
- **What it is:** Sequential presentation of 3 pairs to build into a continuous story
- **How it helps:** Trains progressive story construction as pairs arrive during actual solving

#### 8-Pair Chain
- **What it is:** 8 pairs presented sequentially for one continuous story/scene
- **How it helps:** Prepares for edge memorization with extended narrative construction

#### Journey Mode
- **What it is:** 15+ pairs distributed across multiple memory palace locations
- **How it helps:** Trains memory palace navigation and optimal story-to-location distribution

#### Full Cube Simulation
- **What it is:** ~20 pairs representing a complete BLD solve (edges + corners)
- **How it helps:** Ultimate test of all skills combined under realistic solve conditions

#### Edge Notation Drill
- **What it is:** Identify Speffz letters from 2-color edge pieces
- **How it helps:** Trains automatic piece recognition to prevent notation errors

#### Corner Notation Drill
- **What it is:** Identify Speffz letters from 3-color corner pieces
- **How it helps:** Builds automatic corner recognition for complex 3-sticker identification

**Access:** Select a drill type, then click "üìñ Learn More About This Drill" button.
