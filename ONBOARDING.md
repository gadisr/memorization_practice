## Technical Implementation

### State Management

The onboarding system uses localStorage to track:
- Completion status

### Event System

Custom events handle navigation and interactions:
- `onboardingNext` - Move to next screen
- `onboardingPrevious` - Move to previous screen
- `onboardingSkip` - Skip current screen or entire onboarding
- `onboardingAction` - Handle interactive element actions
- `onboardingDemo` - Launch interactive demonstrations

### Integration with Main App

The main application automatically:
1. Detects if onboarding should be shown
2. Redirects new users to onboarding flow
3. Applies recommendations after completion
4. Shows appropriate tutorial buttons for returning users

## Usage
